# CoffeeVendingMachine
## Description of the Project
This is a Java console application that simulates a coffee machine. The coffee machine offers three different types of coffee: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino. The user can buy a coffee of their choice, provided that the machine has enough ingredients to make it. The machine also allows the user to fill it up with more ingredients, take the money in the money box, or view the remaining ingredients and money in the machine.
## Requirements
In order to utilize this program, it is necessary to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as IntelliJ IDEA, installed on your system, along with an appropriate editor.
## Working
* buy: allows you to buy a coffee of your choice.
* fillIngredients: lets you add more ingredients to the machine.
*  take: allows you to take the money in the money box.
*  show: displays the remaining ingredients and money in the machine.
*  analytics: shows the total number of coffees sold, total amount earned, and total ingredients consumed.
*  exit: exits the program.
*To select an option, type its name and press Enter. If you select buy, you will be prompted to choose a type of coffee:
Type the number of the coffee you want to buy and press Enter. If there are enough ingredients in the machine to make the selected coffee, it will be dispensed and the corresponding amount of money will be added to the money box. If there are not enough ingredients, an error message will be displayed and no coffee will be dispensed.
